**Introduction**

Netflix was found in 1998 and still maintains first place in the OTT market. In the past days, people used DVD to watch movies, now we watch through
online streaming. Growth of Technologies and innovations in every field help people in various ways. I chose to analyze netflix recommendation engine because 
of its unique algorithm. It is the key player of the success of netflix which keeps them going.

There are so many entertaining websites in this world. For example, Amazon is a platform for different fields like AWS, prime video, Amazon music, shopping etc.
But Netflix streams only movies and tv shows with full customer satifaction and this got my attention. I am too eager to analyze the netflix recommendation engine and to check its key to success.

**Dataset** : My dataset was taken from DataWorld

**Dataset link** : https://data.world/bshen10921/netflix


**Data Description**

There are 12 columns in the dataset

Show_id - Unique Id for movies

Type - shows whether movie or TV show

Title - title of the movie

Director - name of the Director

Cast - Actor and Actress name

Country - country where the movie was shot

Date_added - when movie was added in netflix

Release_year - when movie was released

Rating - rating for the movie

Duration - hours of the movie

Genres - shows the kind of movie

Description - Explains shortly about the movie


**1.What is your issue of interest ?**

I am amazed about their unique algorithm of recommendation system which connects people from different countries by recommending favorite movies. And the amazing factor is that they still maintain number one position in the market among so many companies from 1998. Hence I wanted to know the pattern and key to success.

**2.why is this issue important to you and to others ?**

Eventhough they have the best recommendation system in the world, still there are so many great movies are missing in netflix. For example, I dont prefer netflix to watch my native language movies because netflix don't have many South Indian films. Hence I needed to find out how their system recommends movies and tv shows. If they focus on other language movies widely than English, they can earn more money and people will get to watch more movies in netflix.

**3.what questions do you have in your mind ?**

  i) I was thinking which model would work for this, 
  
  ii) will I be able to build a great recommendation system with given dataset.

**4.Where do you get the data to analyze ?**

  i) I took data from Data World, and the link is https://data.world/bshen10921/netflix.
  
  ii) there are 12 columns and 7789 rows
  
  iii) data size is 2.76 MB and there are movies, tv shows from 1947 to 2021.
  
**5.What will be your unit of analysis and Roughly how many units do you expect to analyze ?**

I will analyze more than 5 units like ratings, directors, country, genre, Actors etc.

**6. What kind of models do you use ?**

I am planning to use

   i) KNN clustering
   
   ii) SVD matrix factorization
   
**7. What outcomes do you intend to achieve ?**

I intend to build a good recommendation system. And analyze the different ML models and get the best working model for this recommendation system.
