**Introduction**

Netflix was found in 1998 and still maintains first place in the OTT market. In the past days, people used DVD to watch movies, now we watch through
online streaming. Growth of Technologies and innovations in every field help people in various ways. I chose to analyze netflix recommendation engine because 
of its unique algorithm. It is the key player of the success of netflix which keeps them going.

There are so many entertaining websites in this world. For example, Amazon is a platform for different fields like AWS, prime video, Amazon music, shopping etc.
But Netflix streams only movies and tv shows with full customer satifaction and this got my attention. I am too eager to analyze the netflix recommendation engine and to 
check its key to success.
